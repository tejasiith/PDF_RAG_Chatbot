# PDF_RAG_Chatbot
Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain, FAISS embeddings, and OpenAI GPT-3.5 to enable question-answering over PDF documents, including large research papers and theses. Implemented document chunking, vector indexing, and a Streamlit-based chat interface for interactive querying.
